    <p>The debate between creating a native app for mobile platforms or creating a responsive website has been raging among developers and marketing teams since the advent of modern smartphones and modern web technologies. Modern web technologies now enable native app-like capabilities via a smartphone’s browser, so the question of which solution a company should pursue for their product or service has become a very nuanced one.</p>

    <p>One of the most significant differences between the two options comes in the way they are architected, as Priya Viswanthan of Lifewire explains:</p>

    <p class="quote">Every mobile platform uses a different native programming language. While iOS uses Objective-C, Android uses Java, Windows Mobile uses C++ and so on. Web apps, on the other hand, use languages such as JavaScript, HTML 5, CSS3 or other Web application frameworks as per the developer’s preferences.</p>

    <p>This can often mean developing a responsive website or webapp can be accomplished much faster, and be available across all platforms thanks to the cross-platform nature of the web. It is also much cheaper to develop a responsive website, so cost plays a large role as well. As Kris from SmashStack says:</p>

    <p class="quote">Launching a mobile site is a faster process than designing an application. Nearly all businesses these days need mobile sites to stay competitive anyway, so creating a responsive mobile experience is the least that developers can do. [...] Responsive web design is comparatively cheap when measured against the costs of designing a native mobile app from the ground up.
