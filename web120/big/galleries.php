    <p>Galleries --or Sliders-- are (no surprise, as can be inferred by their name) ways to display and show off media and content on websites, most commonly images, art, or as product carousels. One of the challenges of galleries is in making them work well visually for both desktop and mobile, but luckily with it being such a common and vital element of so many website use cases, there is a vast community of web developers that have developed myriad solutions to the problem, and which do not require the in-depth JQuery knowledge to implement that many of them are created with.</p>

    <p>Bradley Nice, in a Medium blog post about the best JQuery sliders, describes the features of his top choice of gallery plug-ins, LayerSlider:</p>

    <p class="quote">It uses cutting edge technologies to provide the smoothest experience that’s possible, and it comes with more than 200 preset 2D and 3D slide transitions. It’s device friendly by supporting responsive mode, multiple layouts, touch gestures on mobile devices, and uses techniques like lazy load for optimal performance. You can add any content, including images, text, custom HTML, YouTube and Vimeo videos or HTML5 self-hosted multimedia contents. It’s also SEO friendly by allowing you to build semantic markup with custom attributes that search engines can index easily.</p>

    <p>On another list of the most highly recommended galleries, Ashutosh Ks of Hongkiat details his top choice; WOW Slider. He notes some of its better features for web developers, in that it easily integrates into the most popular content management systems, as well as provides an implementation that will display for browsers that do not support its JQuery features.</p>

    <p class="quote">WOW Slider is a jQuery-based image slider that comes with amazing visual effects and helps you create sliders with a few clicks. You can quickly embed it anywhere, thanks to its ‘Insert-to-Page Wizard’ and save-as-plugin options for Joomla and WordPress. It also offers lots of pre-designed themes, import and export features, and includes a no-jQuery, CSS-only fallback as well.
