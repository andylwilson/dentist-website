    <p>Parallax scrolling is a visual effect that is used to instill a sense of depth and movement to a web page, allowing designers to overlay or underlay visual elements and have them scroll at different speeds than the user’s browser as they manually scroll through a page. It also instructs elements on how to disappear or reappear, or fade in or out along with scrolling, creating an immersive experience for the user that can be more compelling than a traditional static website.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, parallax-centered websites tend to restrict themselves to one continuously scrolling page, which often lends itself to a limited amount of use cases and puts a larger burden on the user to wait for extended loading and on the designer to maintain the user’s interest. As Jaymes Brown of Unleashed Technologies details, there are several downsides to implementing a website centered around parallax:</p>

    <p class="quote">SEO takes a hit, websites with a single page allow only one set of meta information, one effective h1 tag, and one URL; A ton of images and other information on one page cause slow load times, causing frustrated visitors to leave the page before they even see it; Not compatible with responsive and mobile design; No internal page linking throughout the website [...]</p>

    <p>Parallax also appears to be a fairly complex technique to implement, requiring knowledge of Javascript and sometimes Javascript frameworks like JQuery to produce. Aniruddha Mysore of Beebom notes that “Making a parallax scrolling site is often tedious because it requires in-depth knowledge of CSS, Javascript and good web design to pull off.” There are however several plug-ins that can be utilized to ease the learning curve, such as ScrollMagic, skrollr, and pagePiling.js.
