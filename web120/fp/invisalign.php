            <p>Invisalign is an exciting new dental technology that straightens teeth without the need for unsightly metal brackets. Straight teeth offer health benefits above and beyond just beautiful aesthetics. With Invisalign, Dr. Singh can help you achieve a healthy smile and straighten teeth comfortably and discreetly.</p>

            <p>Invisalign straightens teeth using a series of customized removable aligners. The aligners are made of clear plastic materials, designed to fit your teeth perfectly. Since Invisalign has no metal wires or brackets it is more comfortable than traditional braces. Plus, easy removal of the trays allows you to eat, drink, and care for your teeth without hassle.</p>

            <p>To begin treatment, 3-D imaging of your teeth will be used to design your series of custom aligners. Every six weeks, Dr. Singh will evaluate your progress and graduate you to a new series of aligners. Often, this treatment can be completed in about one year.</p>

            <p>Invisalign is proven to straighten teeth while going virtually unnoticed by you or those around you. You can rest at ease knowing an Invisalign-trained dentist is helping you attain that much-desired straighter smile! Contact us to learn more.</p>
