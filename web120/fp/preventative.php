            <p>We want to help you keep your smile beautiful and healthy, and you may not realize there’s far more to cleaning teeth than brushing and flossing. At 2200 Westlake Dentistry we evaluate each patient individually to determine which treatment best suits his or her periodontal health to keep that beautiful smile.</p>

            <h2 class="baskerville">2200 Westlake Dentistry uses three types of cleaning procedures:</h2>

            <h3 class="baskerville">Adult Prophylaxis</h3>
            <p>This familiar procedure is described as: scaling and polishing to remove coronal plaque, calculus (mineral buildup) and stains above the gums. We call it good maintenance for patients who have a healthy mouth with no gum or bone problems.<br></p>

            <p>Regular/standard cleaning is not the best method of cleaning if you have mobility of the teeth, bleeding, receded areas where your gums have pulled away from the teeth, or gaps where the spaces around the roots of your teeth are exposed. We can use other procedures for patients who have bone loss, periodontal disease, or infection around their teeth.</p>

            <h3 class="baskerville">Root Planing</h3>
            <p>This procedure removes bacteria, toxins and diseased deposits from the surfaces of tooth roots. It is one of the first steps in treating gum and bone disease, otherwise known as periodontal disease.<br></p>

            <p>Periodontal disease is quite common, but doesn’t always have distinct symptoms. It is an inflammation and infection of the supporting structures of the teeth (gums, bone, ligaments, root surfaces) that eventually results in the loss of your teeth. If your gums bleed easily, are red or swollen, or your teeth appear longer or have shifted, this may be the appropriate treatment for you.</p>

            <h3 class="baskerville">Periodontal Maintenance</h3>
            If you have periodontal disease and we use root planing to remove deposits from the roots of your teeth, standard cleaning treatments are no longer appropriate. Instead, you will require more frequent and in-depth gum and bone care procedures to keep your mouth healthy.<br>

            <p>If you are treated for periodontal disease (through surgery or root planing), we will consult with you and explain the components of an on-going periodontal maintenance program. We typically recommend three months between between appointments for best results.</p>

            <h3 class="baskerville">Additional Periodontal Therapies</h3>
            <p>Your dentist or hygienist may recommend Arestin, systemic antibiotics (oral medication), or a referral to a periodontist as part of your periodontal maintenance program.</p>

            <h3 class="baskerville">Arestin TM</h3>
            <p>Arestin is an antibiotic easily placed in the infected gums around your teeth. It is used to help treat your periodontal disease and help promote healing and pocket reduction after scaling and root planning. It is highly effective because of its localized, targeted application directly to the area of concern. It is non-invasive and effective.</p>

            <h3 class="baskerville">Pediatric Prophylaxis (Pediatric Dentistry)</h3>
            <p>For our youngest patients, we strive to create a positive experience from the outset. We focus on educating parents and child on good oral hygiene and dietary habits. We recommend exams begin as soon as the first tooth erupts, but no later than the first birthday. A dental visit at this age is a well baby checkup for the teeth. Checkups then occur every six months with typical cleanings usually beginning around age 3 or sooner depending on the child comfort level in the dental chair.</p>
