 <p>Hey there! I'm Andy! I was born here in Washington, and grew up between here and south Florida. I'm currently in my second quarter of the Web Design program at Seattle Central Colleges, learning HTML, CSS, and starting to learn some PHP.</p>
 <p>I spent about a year in the Computer Science transfer program here before realizing that abstract engineering (and difficult higher math) wasn't really doing it for me. The things I've always traditionally loved and found the most interesting about software have tended to be tied to design, aesthetics, and interface. I think that in general I'm a more visual, artistically-leaning person, and I'm hoping this field speaks much more to my passions, while staying within the realm of technology. So far so good!</p>
